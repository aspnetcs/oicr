Package opencv was not found in the pkg-config search path

From your question I guess you are using Ubuntu (or a derivate). If you use:

apt-file search opencv.pc

then you see that you have to install libopencv-dev.

After you do so, pkg-config --cflags opencv and pkg-config --libs opencv should work as expected.
